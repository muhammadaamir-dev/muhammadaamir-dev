## 💼 **About Me**

I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** with hands-on experience in the **MERN stack**, focused on building scalable, secure, and performance-driven web applications. I work with **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Next.js, and Node.js** to design RESTful APIs, manage databases, implement authentication systems, and create responsive user interfaces.

I started my professional journey as a **Unity Game Developer**, where I worked on **2D, 3D, and hyper-casual games**. I have experience building games from scratch, implementing UI changes, improving gameplay mechanics, and adding new features using **C# and Unity**. This background strengthened my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and performance optimization mindset.

Currently, my primary focus is **web development**, where I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle—from backend architecture and API development to modern frontend implementation. My game development experience allows me to bring creativity, strong debugging skills, and user-focused thinking into web projects.

I'm continuously learning new technologies, improving my development skills, and open to opportunities that help me grow as a **Web and Full-Stack Developer**.
